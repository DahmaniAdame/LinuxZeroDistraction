# Linux Zero Distraction

I make a living out of the Internet. So, I spend considerable time navigating websites on a daily basis. 

As much I love the massive amount of information and entertainment on the web, there are a couple of details that don't fit in my world but happen to impose their existence to me even when I'm not looking for them. And by that I mean specifically: 

* Ads
* Porn 
* Gambling 
* Scams
* Shitty websites

I've built it using different sources making it more than 100k entries so far. 

## How does it work 

It nullifies access to specific URLs by making them unavailable. 

In Linux, it's done by adding the following format to the /etc/hosts: 
0.0.0.0 target.website.url

## What's in the list? 

The list blocks more than +100k entry from: 
* Ads networks mainly 
* Porn websites
* Gambling websites
* Scam websites
* Shitty websites 

## How to use it?

I only use it on Linux based systems (Arch, Ubuntu, and Android). All you need to do is append the list to your /etc/hosts file right after your own settings. 

I'm not sure how to use the same file on Windows or Mac (haven't used any since 2001)... So, you need to Google things a bit and eventually make it compatible with the other systems. 

Hope it helps :)
